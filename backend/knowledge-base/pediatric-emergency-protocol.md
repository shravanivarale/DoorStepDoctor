## 10. Triage Decision Framework

### Step 1: Assess ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation)
- **Any problem**: EMERGENCY referral

### Step 2: Check for Red Flags
- **Any red flag present**: EMERGENCY referral

### Step 3: Age-Specific Assessment
- **<3 months with fever**: HIGH URGENCY minimum
- **<1 year with any concern**: Lower threshold for referral

### Step 4: Severity Scoring
- **Multiple symptoms**: Increase urgency level
- **Parental concern**: Take seriously, especially if experienced parent
- **Gut feeling**: If something feels wrong, refer

### Step 5: Social Factors
- **Distance to PHC**: >10 km increases urgency
- **Transportation**: Difficult access increases urgency
- **Time of day**: Evening/night increases urgency
- **Monsoon season**: Access issues increase urgency

### Urgency Levels and Actions

| Level | Action | Timeframe | Transport |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| EMERGENCY | Immediate referral | <30 minutes | Ambulance (108) |
| HIGH | PHC referral | 2-4 hours | Arrange transport |
| MEDIUM | PHC visit | Same day | Family transport |
| LOW | Home care + monitoring | 24-48 hours | Follow-up visit |

## Special Considerations for Rural Settings

### Limited Resources
- **No oxygen**: Refer earlier for respiratory distress
- **No IV access**: Refer earlier for dehydration
- **No ambulance**: Arrange community transport for emergencies

### Distance Factors
- **>10 km to PHC**: Lower threshold for referral
- **Poor roads**: Consider weather and accessibility
- **Night time**: Arrange safe transport, consider waiting until morning for non-emergencies

### Cultural Considerations
- **Traditional remedies**: Assess for harmful practices
- **Delayed presentation**: Often see sicker children
- **Gender bias**: Ensure equal care for girls
- **Parental literacy**: Use simple language, visual aids

### Communication
- **Language**: Use local language, avoid medical jargon
- **Reassurance**: Calm anxious parents
- **Instructions**: Clear, simple, written if possible
- **Follow-up**: Ensure understanding of when to return

2. **Trust instincts**: If worried, refer
3. **ABCs first**: Always check airway, breathing, circulation
4. **Red flags**: Memorize and act immediately
5. **Fever in infants**: <3 months with fever = always refer
6. **Dehydration**: Assess carefully, ORS saves lives
7. **Seizures**: Time them, protect from injury, refer if >5 minutes
8. **Poisoning**: Never induce vomiting, always refer
9. **Communication**: Calm parents, clear instructions
10. **Documentation**: Record everything for continuity of care
